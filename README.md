# Spellnet

A simple mobile app to check paper MtG prices in BRL currency (Android only for now)

## Using

- Go to https://www.mtggoldfish.com/ or some other deck building site you love
- Find a link to a `.dec` file of the deck
- Click and hold, and then share with the Spellnet app
- Name the deck and it will be added to you collection
- Update how many cards of each you already have
  - The value on the right is the sum of the prices of how many cards you still need 
  - If you have all needed the value will be 0.00, and the card name will turn green
- At the bottom of the deck list, you'll have the current completion status of your deck
